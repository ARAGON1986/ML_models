GUIDING PRINCIPLES IN AI
	Moral and ethical considerations
	Decisions that are illegal,cannot be explained,harmful 
	Fairness
		Decisions made on innacurate parameters 
	
	Reliability and Safety
		Build trust
	
	Privacy and security
		protect data of citizens
	
	Inclusiveness
		Everyone should benefit from intelligent technology
	
	Transparency
		How were the AI decisions made, impacts on people's lives
	
	Accountability
		People who design and deploy AI must be accountable
		
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MACHINE LEARNING ON AZURE
	REGRESSION
		Supervised learning, result is numeric
	CLASSIFICATION
		BINARY CLASSIFICATION
		MULTICLASS CLASSIFICATION 
		Supervised learning, assigns odds of cluster
	CLUSTERING
		Unsupervised learning, find groups of related things in data 
	
DEEP LEARING
	Subset of machine learning where neural networks with layers (RNN - Recurrent neural networks)
	
CORE MACHINE LEARNING CONCEPTS
	FEATURES: Input
	LABELS: Output
	TRAIN DATA
	VALIDATION DATA 
	MEAN SQUARE ERROR
	CONFUSION MATRIX
		True Postive, False Negative
		TPR - True Positive rate, sensitivity
		FPR - False positive rate, fallout rate 
		ROC - Receiver Operating Characteristic TPR vs FPR 
		AUC - Area under the curve TPR vs FPR 
		
		Recall - TP/(TP+FN)
		Accuracy - (TP+TN)/Total number of cases.
		Precision - TP/(TP+FP)
		F1 Score- 2TP/(2TP+FP+FN)
		Selectivity  - TN/(TN+FP)
